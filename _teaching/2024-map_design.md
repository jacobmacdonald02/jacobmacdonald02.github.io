## <span style="color:white">WANT TO TAKE PART IN AN ONLINE RESEARCH STUDY?</span>


<span style="color: white;">I'm looking for University of Sheffield students (any level; any department) to fill out a short survey on graphic design and cartography. This can be done online, and should take about 20 minutes.</span>


### <span style="color:white">About the trial</span>

<span style="color: white;">- By clicking the link below, you will be taken to a randomly allocated online trial which explores graphic design choices, cartography and knowledge retention.</span>

<span style="color: white;">- You will be guided through a series of Google Forms where you will first look at a map, and then be asked a series of questions about the map.</span>
 
<span style="color: white;">- Once you start answering questions about the map, do not return to look at the map (or take any notes about it beforehand, etc.).</span>
 
<span style="color: white;">- You should conduct this survey on a computer. It would be useful in some cases to be able to zoom in a bit more on the map, which is difficult on a mobile device.</span>
 
<span style="color: white;">- You will be asked a pseudo-anonymous ID at each stage. This will let us connect the answers together while maintaining anonymity. Please come up with a random <WORD><NUMBER> combination (e.g. cat09; train329). This can be anything unique BUT PLEASE REMEMBER IT AND ENTER IT CONSISTENTLY FOR EACH ROUND OF MAPS YOU ARE LOOKING AT.</span>
