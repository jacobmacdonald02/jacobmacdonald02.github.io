### <span style="color:white">Abstract</span>

This report outlines the findings of a research study to examine the potential impact on the park homes sector of a change to the maximum commission paid on the sale of a park home.

In 2018, the government made a commitment to commission research to gather data to enable a detailed assessment of the likely impacts on residents and site owners, of a change to the 10% commission on sales.

The government commissioned the University of Liverpool and Sheffield Hallam Universities in March 2021 to carry out research. This report outlines their key findings and recommendations.
