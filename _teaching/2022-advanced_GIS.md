## <span style="color:white">Module Instructor</span>
Fall 2022


This module is aimed at participants who already have a good degree of knowledge in ArcGIS or similar software programmes. The module aims to develop a high degree of competence in relation to spatial analysis, understanding spatial approaches to problem solving, and the theories and precepts which underlie software applications in GIS. The module is taught through a series of inter-related computer workshops focusing on real-world data and policy problem scenarios. The assessment for this module is based on a multiple choice exam and a 2,000 word advanced methods report.


### <span style="color:white">Aims</span>
The aim of this module is to provide you with hands-on experience of advanced GIS methods through a variety of spatial analysis problems based on real-world examples. More specifically, the unit aims to:

- Develop your knowledge and understanding in relation to advanced spatial analysis concepts which underpin software operations in GIS.
- Assist you in reaching a high degree of competence in relation to advanced spatial analysis methods.
- Develop core skills in representing the results of advanced spatial analysis in a visual format.


### <span style="color:white">Learning Outcomes</span>
By the end of the unit, you should be able to demonstrate:

- A high level of knowledge in relation to the conceptual and analytical underpinnings of advanced spatial analysis methods in GIS software.
- A high level of competence in performing spatial analysis techniques in an industry-leading GIS software package.
- Familiarity with the range of possible applications of advanced GIS methods in professional practice.
- The ability to perform advanced spatial tasks in a leading GIS software package.
- Proficiency in taking the results of more complex spatial analysis and geoprocessing tasks and representing them visually in a meaningful manner.
- A critical understanding of the potentials of, and limitations to, advanced spatial analysis methods.
