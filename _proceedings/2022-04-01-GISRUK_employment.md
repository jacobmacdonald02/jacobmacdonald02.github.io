### <span style="color:white">Abstract</span>

This works looks at the delineation of urban employment subcentres in London, England, and their sector based typologies. The location of these areas of high employment density are delineated using open source small area employment data and an algorithm based on an urban monocentric density decay. Broad comparisons of sector based business typologies in each area highlight how different employment hubs cater to varying businesses and local stakeholders.
