### <span style="color:white">Module Aims</span>
This module aims to develop your understanding and skills in undertaking research in urban contexts. These key skills will be important in planning and undertaking your dissertation at level 3. You will develop your research skills by focusing on a ‘real life’ problem or challenge in a particular place. The problem is flood risk management (FRM), the place is Hull in Yorkshire. The module will be supported by a field trip to Hull and Rotterdam.  

Flood management is a real and present threat in many countries and urban areas and hence requires active planning. Flood management also influences water supply and environmental protection more broadly. Flood risk is unequal, with the more deprived usually at greater risk and also more vulnerable. Given a situation of accelerating global warming, flood management is a topic with which planners in all countries will have to grapple for years to come.
