## <i><span style="color:white">The red, green and blue of urban environmental data science</span></i>

<br />
Data is everywhere and can increasingly give us insights into our complex urban systems and cities. Detailed spatial data on the neighbourhood environment and urban hazards paired with secondary data sources can help us understand how people value and interact with their locations. We can leverage this environmental-urban data science framework using pollution (the red), flooding (the blue), and our urban flora (the green) to build environ-equitable and resilient communities going forward â€“ led by best practices and research-driven policies
