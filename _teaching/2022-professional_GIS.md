Spring 2022; 2023; 2024


This is a project-based module based on a real-world professional GIS project for an external client using a variety of different spatial datasets and GIS methods. The aim of the module is to prepare you for professional practice in GIS and spatial analysis through a group-work approach which places emphasis on collaboration, team working, objective-setting and delivery of specified outputs at key points. This module is taught through a couple of lectures and supervised group work sessions. It is assessed through a combination of an interim report, final report and group presentation in addition to a mandatory – but non-assessed – peer-review and self-assessment. Individual briefs for each project will be circulated separately.
