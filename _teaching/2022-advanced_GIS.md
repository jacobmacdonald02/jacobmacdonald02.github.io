This module is aimed at participants who already have a good degree of knowledge in ArcGIS or similar software programmes. The module aims to develop a high degree of competence in relation to spatial analysis, understanding spatial approaches to problem solving, and the theories and precepts which underlie software applications in GIS. The module is taught through a series of inter-related computer workshops focusing on real-world data and policy problem scenarios. The assessment for this module is based on a multiple choice exam and a 2,000 word advanced methods report.
