## <i><span style="color:white">The Open Research Project Life Cycle: From Getting the Ideaâ€¦ to Getting the Idea Out There</span></i>

<br />
The overall objectives of this talk will be to bring participants along and showcase how an academic research project can be built entirely from accessible resources, open data and open software/ technologies. Starting from "Getting the idea" moving to "Getting the data" and finishing with "Getting the results out there" - all emphasizing how the entire process can be supported by 'open' tools. This presentation and talk allows for time for Q&A at the end.
