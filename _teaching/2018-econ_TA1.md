### <span style="color:white">Course Goals</span>

Microeconomics is an introduction to economic modeling. We teach how to use rigorous analysis and analytical tools to understand (i) how economic agents choose how to allocate scarce resources and (ii) the interaction of the individual choices in the society.

### <span style="color:white">Learning Objectives</span>

**A. Knowledge and Understanding**

As a result of completing this course you should be able to:
- Understand micro economic theory at an intermediate level
- Conduct graphical and algebraic quantitative analyses
- Apply supply and demand logic to policy problems
- Critically evaluate economic arguments in media and policy sources

**B. Specific Skills**

- Modeling consumer behavior
- The relationship between preferences and utility
- Income and substitution effects
- Cognitive biases and their impact on decision making
- Modeling firm production processes, understanding the link between production and costs
- Understanding the time horizons of short and long run, their meaning and implications for production processes
- Understanding the consequences of market power in firm’s decisions, in particular pricing
- Understanding the consequences of market power for producer, consumer, and total welfare
- Listing and analyzing the reasons for the existence of monopolies
- Possibilities of government intervention (regulation) in face of firm’s market power
- Understanding price determination and the consequences of market power in product markets

**C. General Skills**

Using economic modeling tools to approach real-life issues, based on policy examples and actual economic agents’ behavior and markets. The course makes extensive use of real-life examples to discuss the topics. It thus improves the student’s ability to consume and critically analyze economic and financial news.
