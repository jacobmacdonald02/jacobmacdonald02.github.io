### <span style="color:white">Module Description</span>

This module introduces students to powerful and commonly used statistical methods in the social sciences. It assumes no prior statistical knowledge and focuses on the practical research priorities of selecting, conducting and interpreting the most appropriate test with an eye to, rather than an obsession with, the underpinning statistical foundations. The module uses weekly seminar sessions and practicalâ€™s to build practical software skills (using open source coding in R) alongside conceptual understanding.
