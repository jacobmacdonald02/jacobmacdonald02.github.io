## <span style="color:white">Module Leader</span>
Fall 2022


### <span style="color:white">Module Description</span>

This module introduces students to powerful and commonly used statistical methods in the social sciences. It assumes no prior statistical knowledge and focuses on the practical research priorities of selecting, conducting and interpreting the most appropriate test with an eye to, rather than an obsession with, the underpinning statistical foundations. The module uses weekly seminar sessions and practicalâ€™s to build practical software skills (using open source coding in R) alongside conceptual understanding.


### <span style="color:white">Module Aims</span>

- A1. Develop understanding of key concepts in statistical data analysis
- A2. Develop understanding of descriptive statistics and exploratory data analysis
- A3. Develop understanding of issues of sampling and inferential data analysis
- A4. Familiarise students with a range of methods for the statistical analysis of bivariate and multivariate problems
- A5. Develop skills in the quantification, assessment and analysis of bivariate and multivariate relationships


### <span style="color:white">Learning Outcomes</span>

By the end of the module, a student will be able to demonstrate:

- LO1. An understanding of the underlying concepts of statistical analysis (A1/A2)
- LO2. A capacity to undertake and critically interpret sampling and inferential data analysis, including sample accuracy, sample errors and confidence intervals (A3)
- LO3. The ability to conduct and critically interpret a range of bivariate and multivariate relationship estimation methods (A4)
- LO4. The ability to undertake and interpret the results from various forms of statistical analysis within different statistical packages (A5)
