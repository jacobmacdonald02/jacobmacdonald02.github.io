        <span style="color: white; font-weight:bold; font-size:17px;">Points:</span> <span style="color: white; font-size:15px;">Here, we have a map of all populated places on the island of Newfoundland which have "Point" in their name. While not an inhabited settlement, and not shown here, by far the most famous 'Point' is likely to be <a href="https://whc.unesco.org/en/list/1497/" target="_blank">Mistaken Point</a> (Furthest Cape to the South-East). Here, for many years, sailors were often fatally <i>mistaken</i> in their navigation due to weather and visibility. Thinking they had made it to the inhabited and navigable Cape Race, they would turn northwards and straight into the fog-masked cliffs. Mistaken Point is home to the worlds oldest fossils of complex organisms and about 600 km away from the Titanic's final resting place, being the receiver of the distress call.</span>

        <span style="color: white; font-weight:bold; font-size:17px;">Lines:</span> <span style="color: white; font-size:15px;">The Trans-Canada Highway is one of the lifelines of the country, linking the east and west coast across approx. 7,500 km. Work on the route started around 1950, with the main road spanning all ten provinces and 905 km in Newfoundland itself. Probably the most well known sentiment many Canadians have with the TCH relates to Terry Fox's Marathon of Hope. In April 1980, he first dipped his prosthetic leg off the St. John's coast at Mile 0 and ran his way across Canada, changing the face of Cancer research and lives everywhere.</span>

        <span style="color: white; font-weight:bold; font-size:17px;">Polygons:</span> <span style="color: white; font-size:15px;">The ever important Moose Management Areas of Newfoundland. Originally not native to the island, <a href="https://heritagenl.ca/discover/provincial-historic-commemorations-program-designations/introduction-of-moose-to-the-island-of-newfoundland/" target="_blank">four moose were brought to Newfoundland in 1904</a> and they’ve since exploded on the scene with over 120,000 in number now. They can be a bit daft, wandering onto the roads and into cities to eat what they can find and lick the road salt in the winter. Newfoundland has some of the highest density of moose around, and vehicle collisions are a major issue in the province with around 600 accidents a year, often fatal. Lots of resources and interventions go into moose management as seen by the <a href="https://www.gov.nl.ca/ffa/files/22282-Moose-Management-Report-July-12.pdf" target="_blank">Gov. NL 2022-26 Moose Management Plan</a>.</span>
