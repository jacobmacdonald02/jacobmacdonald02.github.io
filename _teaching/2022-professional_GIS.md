## <span style="color:white">Module Instructor</span>
Fall 2022


This is a project-based module based on a real-world professional GIS project for an external client using a variety of different spatial datasets and GIS methods. The aim of the module is to prepare you for professional practice in GIS and spatial analysis through a group-work approach which places emphasis on collaboration, team working, objective-setting and delivery of specified outputs at key points. This module is taught through a couple of lectures and supervised group work sessions. It is assessed through a combination of an interim report, final report and group presentation in addition to a mandatory – but non-assessed – peer-review and self-assessment. Individual briefs for each project will be circulated separately.


### <span style="color:white">Aims</span>
The aim of this module is to familiarise you with the nature of the client-analyst relationship in the field of GIS and to develop in you the ability to produce relevant research focused on a specific policy problem. More specifically, the unit aims to:

- Engender in you the ability to work as part of a team to produce a discrete piece of GIS research within a fixed time frame.
- Develop your ability to work on a professional GIS project.
- Help you develop an awareness of the potential of GIS in professional practice.
- Provide you with the opportunity to develop your communicative and analytical abilities in relation to disseminating the results of your work.


### <span style="color:white">Learning Outcomes</span>
By the end of the unit, you should be able to demonstrate:
- The ability to work effectively, as part of a team, to produce a series of high quality outputs on a pre-defined GIS research topic.
- The ability to work with effectively on a client-based project by adhering closely to the project brief.
- Knowledge on the role that GIS and spatial analysis methods can play in helping organisations increase the potential of their data to inform their current practice and future plans.
- A high degree of competence in visualising the results of your project analysis in a meaningful way.
- The ability to manage disparate workflows and tasks and to combine such work into coherent pieces of written work.
- Expertise in oral communication of key messages from a discrete research project and the ability to justify the selection of GIS research methods and dissemination techniques.
